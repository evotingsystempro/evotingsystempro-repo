# eVoting System Pro 🗳️

> Secure · Transparent · Precise

---

### Project Overview

**eVoting System Pro** is a digital voting platform built with **React Native (Expo)** and **Firebase**. It allows organizers to create and run secure, verifiable polls and elections — from single-choice leadership votes to multi-candidate committee elections — with real-time results and built-in fraud prevention.

---

## 🎯 Core Features

- 🔘 **Single-Choice Polls** — Voters select exactly one candidate. Ideal for elections, leadership votes, and referendums.
- ☑️ **Multiple-Choice Polls** — Voters select multiple candidates in one poll. Ideal for committee elections and ranked preference voting.
- 💳 **Pay-Per-Vote** — Charge a fee per vote, collected via Mobile Money, Card, or Crypto before a vote is cast.
- 📄 **Import Eligible Voters** — Upload a CSV, Excel, or text file of eligible voters so only registered participants can vote.
- ⏰ **Scheduled Voting Windows** — Set a precise start and end time; voting opens and closes automatically.
- 📊 **Real-Time Results** — Live charts and counters update instantly as votes are cast and verified.
- 🛡️ **Fraud Prevention & Security** — Device fingerprinting and server-side verification block duplicate votes, bots, and manipulation attempts.
- 👥 **Voter Management Dashboard** — Admins can view registered voters, track who has voted, and manage eligibility in real time.
- 🔔 **Push Notification Alerts** — Voters are notified when a poll opens, closes, or results are published.
- 📥 **Export Results** — Download final results as a PDF or Excel report for record-keeping, auditing, or public announcement.
